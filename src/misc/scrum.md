# SCRUM

**Story**: deliverable that the product owner cares about.

**Task**: non-deliverable that the team, but not the product owner does not cares
about.

**Note**: A bit floating definitions. In Jira, an **Epic** is overreaching goal
containing **Stories**. **Tasks** are smaller and cannot be time-estimated.

## Backlog Refinement

Make sure product backlog is in shape

- Refined (has a Definition of Done)
- Ordered according to importance
- Break down items to reasonable size

## Sprint Planning

Each story has 3 variables:

- scope      (set by product owner)
- importance (set by product owner)
- estimate   (set by team)

Estimate the stories. This might in turn make the PO alter scope or importance.

The team (no the product owner) decides on how many stories to include in the
sprint. The product owner can affect what gets included by

- re-prioritizing
- change scope of a story
- split a story

### Sprint length

A compromise between being _agile_ (change of direction, shorter feedback cycles,
deploy more often) and _working undisturbed_ (less administrative overhead, focus
and momentum)
