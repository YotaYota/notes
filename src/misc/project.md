# Project

Declarative IoT

## Easy to Refactor

Keep code as modular as possible.

Keep coupling as low as possible.

Tested code is easier to refactor.

## Reduce Cognitive Load

Repetition and pedagogical code is good.

## Things I'd Like to Inclue

- DDD
- Twelve Factor App
- 3-Tier Architecture
- Easy to run locally
- Easy to scale backend
- Don't skip documentation, assume I'm going to forget
