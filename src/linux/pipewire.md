# PipeWire

```bash
sudo apt install pipewire
```

**Note**: The burden of watching for new streams and connecting them to the appropriate output device or application is left to an external component known as a **session manager**.

Recommended session manager is [WirePlumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/#). (pipewire-media-session is deprecated)
