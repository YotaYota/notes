# NETCONF YANG

NETCONF is a protocol defined by IETF to install, manipulate and delete the configuration of network devices.

NETCONF operations are realized on top of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer using an XML encoding and provides a basic set of operations to edit and query configuration on a network device.
