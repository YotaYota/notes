# SCRUM

**Story**: deliverable that the product owner cares about.

**Task**: non-deliverable that the team, but not the product owner does not cares
about.

## Backlog Refinement

Make sure product backlog is in shape with important items in ordinal importance
scale.

## Sprint Planning

Each story has 3 variables:

- scope (set by product owner)
- importance (set by product owner)
- estimate (set by team)

Estimate the stories. This might in turn alter
- scope
- importance

Break down stories to reasonable size.

Break down stories into tasks.

The team (no the product owner) decides on how many stories to include in the
sprint. The product owner can affect what gets included by
- reprioritize
- change scope of a story
- split a story

### Sprint length

Short

- allows for being agile (change direction)
- shorter feedback cycles
- deploy more often

Long

- less overhead in terms of planning etc
- build momentum
