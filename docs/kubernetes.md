# Kubernetes

Open Source orchestration system for Docker containers.

Handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster.
Actively manages work loads so that state matches the user's declared intentions.

Using the concept of labels and pods it groups the containers which makes up an
application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

Pod: a runnable unit of work. Usually 1 container.

Service: tells what services your application provides.

Volume: represents a location where containers can access and store information.

Namespace: grouping mechanism and isolation from other parts of the cluster.
