# Motivation

I want to move forward all the time and not stand still. Even if my current
approach is not solving the problem I want it to matter and be a step towards
the solution.

# Goals

- I want to avoid going in cirles; redo the same approach several times if it is
unsuccesseful because this wastes time and creates a stand still.
- Even if an approach doesn't solve the problem, I want to be clear on
what sub-goals and conclusions I can get from the approach.

# Strategy
### Divide the problem.
Try to divide the problem into isolated parts that can be solved individually.

# Procedure

1. When I have a task that needs to be done, the first step should be to stop
and turn to pen and paper.
2. Try to clearly define the goal and come up with different strategies for
achieving this.
3. Weigh the different strategies against each other and initially choose one
to start with.
4. Be clear on what strategy is choosen and try exactly this (if I get new
ideas, write them down on paper for later consideration).
5. When I reach some kind of end point of the choosen approach, evaluate the
conclusions and save them.

When working on one approach, set all others aside. If I get a new idea while
doing an approach: write it down and save for later.

# 

- Work become more granulary, and it feels less
heavy.
- It is easier to find a comfortable pace.
- Gets you more mentally involved and increases understanding of what I'm
  acutally trying to solve.
